# Building a CLI Application With Argparse

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a method of interacting with a computer program by entering text commands. It provides a way of controlling programs, executing tasks, and manipulating system resources through a terminal or command prompt. A CLI offers a powerful and efficient way of interacting with programs, with developers and advanced users preferring to use it.

To build programs that accept input through the command line, the Python library avails the `argparse` module. The module simplifies the process of building command-line interfaces by providing the functionality to define command-line arguments, parse arguments, validate the user input, and generate help messages.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use the `argparse` module by building a ToDo application that will be operated through the Command-Line. This project will serve as an example of introducing the various concepts of `argparse` and demonstrating their practical use. Therefore, throughout the tutorial, we will build the application incrementally while exploring the different features of the `argparse` module.
